GRAPH: A list of pairs of ‚Äúthings‚Äù called vertex/vertices, and lines between those points, called edges.
ùê¥ = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)} 
ùêµ = {(A, B), (B, C), (A, C), (A, D)} 
ùê∂ = {(LHR, KRA), (LHR, ISB), (FSD, SWL), (STD, MUL)}


Total Edges: (n(n-1))/2


Difference Between Undirected Graphs and Directed Gaphs:
A directed graph is a graph where the edges have a direction, meaning each edge connects an ordered pair of vertices.
An undirected graph is a graph where the edges have no direction, connecting pairs of vertices without any order.


Graph Representation:

Edge List
Individual track of all edges
Need to check all edges

Adjacency List
Track of all adjacent to a particular edge
Need to check relevant list of adjacent 

Adjacency Matrix
Table in form of rows and columns that keep track of all possible edges in terms of YES/NO
Only need to check one cell.


Things we need for our area of research:
How to traverse a graph
Count neighbors of a vertex
Deleting and inserting edges
Path and cycle of vertices


Graph in Board Games
Most board games are played on a two-dimensional grid. 
- Nodes represent the cells where game pieces are placed. 
- Winning conditions involve finding paths (edges) with consecutive stones.


Implementation
Topics like graph theory, and recursion play crucial roles in modeling and solving the game.
